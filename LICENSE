                              PREAMBLE

The FiveM Cheat Detector software ("the Software") represents a significant 
advancement in the detection and prevention of unauthorized modifications and 
cheating software in the FiveM gaming environment. This Software embodies 
substantial intellectual effort and technical innovation in the fields of 
forensic analysis, system monitoring, and cheat detection.

This license is designed to protect the rights of both the creators of the 
Software and those who wish to use, modify, or distribute it. The MIT License 
has been chosen as the foundation for this agreement due to its permissive 
nature and widespread acceptance in the open-source community, while this 
extended version provides additional clarity and context for users.

The Software includes advanced capabilities for detecting various forms of 
cheating software, including but not limited to: process monitoring, registry 
analysis, file scanning, network traffic analysis, and forensic investigation 
of system artifacts. These capabilities are designed to help server 
administrators maintain fair play environments and identify potential violations 
of gaming platform terms of service.

   may be modified or disabled by the Licensee as needed.

                       TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

The FiveM Cheat Detector implements several advanced technical approaches to 
identify potential cheating software:

1. PROCESS ANALYSIS:
   The Software examines running processes for signatures matching known cheat 
   software, suspicious naming patterns, unusual command line parameters, and 
   abnormal behavior patterns.

2. REGISTRY FORENSICS:
   The Software analyzes the Windows Registry for evidence of cheat software 
   installation, configuration, or execution, including historical entries that 
   may indicate previous use of cheating tools.

3. FILE SYSTEM SCANNING:
   The Software scans for files matching known cheat signatures, examines file 
   metadata, and identifies suspicious file patterns or locations that may 
   indicate the presence of unauthorized modifications.

4. NETWORK ANALYSIS:
   The Software examines network connections, DNS configurations, and firewall 
   settings that may indicate communication with cheat servers or attempts to 
   bypass game security measures.

5. FORENSIC CAPABILITIES:
   The Software includes Process Hacker-like features to detect historical 
   evidence of cheat usage, even after uninstallation, through analysis of 
   system journals, prefetch files, and other artifacts.

                        LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

The use of this Software may be subject to local laws and regulations regarding 
privacy, data protection, and computer access. Users are responsible for ensuring

                           CONCLUSION

This license grants extensive freedom to use, modify, and distribute the Software 
while providing context for its intended use and technical capabilities. The 
Licensor hopes that the Software will contribute to maintaining fair play in 
gaming environments and advancing the state of the art in cheat detection and 
system security analysis.
